1. copy your linklayer .o files into the protocol folder

2. compile the application with ./build.sh, which will build with your protocol .o code

3. compile and run the virtual cable program

4. test the protocol
4.1 run the receiver: ./main /dev/ttyS11 tx penguin-received.gif
4.2 run the transmitter: ./main /dev/ttyS10 rx penguin.gif
4.3 should have received a nice looking penguin

5. test the protocol with cable unplugging and noise
5.1. run receiver and transmitter again
5.2. quickly move to the cable program console and press 0 for unplugging the cable, 2 to add noise, and 1 to normal
5.3 should have received a nice looking penguin even if cable disconnected or noise added
